# Hardcore HTML on ICP

This project demonstrates the minimal setup needed to deploy static HTML on the Internet Computer. We started with the default dfx template (Motoko + Vanilla JS) and stripped it down to its bare essentials.

## What We Removed

### 1. Backend

- Removed the entire backend folder containing Motoko code
- Removed the corresponding backend canister configuration from `dfx.json`

### 2. Package Management

The original template had two package.json files:

- Root `package.json`: Used for workspace management and global scripts
- Frontend `package.json`: Contained frontend-specific dependencies

We removed both after eliminating all dependencies:

Frontend dependencies removed:

- `@dfinity/agent`, `@dfinity/candid`, `@dfinity/principal`: IC JavaScript integration - not needed for static HTML
- `lit-html`: HTML templating library - not needed for static HTML
- `vite`: Build tool and dev server - not needed for static files
- `typescript`: TypeScript compiler - not needed for pure HTML
- `sass`: CSS preprocessor - not needed for basic styling
- `vitest`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`: Testing utilities - not needed
- `cross-fetch`: Fetch polyfill - not needed
- `dotenv`: Environment variable management - not needed
- `vite-plugin-environment`: Vite plugin - not needed

### 3. Configuration Files

- Removed `tsconfig.json` files (both root and frontend) - TypeScript configuration not needed
- Removed `vite.config.js` - Build tool configuration not needed
- Removed all JavaScript source files from `src/`

### 4. Build Output Directory

In the default template, the source directory is set to `src/html_frontend/dist`. This `dist` directory is used because:

- It's the output directory for Vite's build process
- It contains compiled/bundled files:
  - Transpiled JavaScript from TypeScript
  - Processed CSS from SCSS
  - Optimized assets
  - Generated HTML with injected build-time variables

Since we're not using any build tools or preprocessing, we changed the source directory in `dfx.json` to point directly to `src/html_frontend`. This means:

- No build step needed
- Direct deployment of our static files
- What you write is what gets deployed

## What Remains

The minimal structure needed to deploy HTML on ICP:

## Deafu

Welcome to your new `html` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `html`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd html/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
